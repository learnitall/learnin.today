title: "Woah That's Fruitful (WTF) Intensive: Digesting a Fire Hose"

During the past week on this global intensive for COEN3050, our little
band of merry travelers have gone on 24+ excursions within four distinct
regions: Kampala, Entebbe, Lake Bunyonyi and Kigali. We've seen everything from
the Katanga slums and the Kigali Genocide Memorial, to incredible jaw-dropping
feats of nature, all of which we will never forget.

I had made it my mission during the start of this trip to capture our experiences
in a way that would convey their meaningfulness. I wanted to share what I was
learning and doing with those who were interested so they may obtain second-hand
awareness for the important takeaways us Westerners were, well, taking away from
this trip. What's funny is that over the past week, this is exactly what I haven't
been doing.

The last time I published something about this trip was two days ago, but that
post a reflection on our first day in Kampala over a week ago. So why did this
occur? Why did I not succeed? What happened that had caused me to not achieve
this goal I was at one point so motivated to lunge for?

> Well, I tripped and broke both my arms.

Nah nothing along those lines- maybe not so much for my parents, but that would've
been an easy answer. After some reflection, I've determined there is not one, but
three considerations in addressing this issue.

**Form yOur Opinions, Ban Accurately Reciting**

A couple of days ago, our amazing professor on this trip posed a question to
try and help us digest this incredible Fire Hose that has been pouring information
into us since Day 00. She essentially asked us to reflect on what we have learned
about and then try and conclude what we have learned from those things we have
learned about. Of course, she put it more eloquently than I, however the concept
of learning about something (memorizing facts, history, etc.) and learning
from something (forming conclusions and inferences) is super powerful and
was an incredibly helpful tool in prioritization of thought.

In my initial posts I was trying so so hard to accurately retell my day, that
two seeds were planted into my mind:

* *Holy shit there's a lot to remember, what if I forget?*
* *Holy shit what am I going to say?*

I was so worried about trying to remember all that was learned about that the
learned from became shadowed. These posts became more of a responsibility than
an enjoyable exercise, which is why I kept putting them off. I just didn't want
to do them and instead I found myself drifting towards focusing more on internally
and interpersonally discussing how the trip is important.

## WTF

**Woah That's Fruitful**

What our Lost Boys and Girls have also learned is that we are constantly moving.
We eat breakfast, travel and learn until 2, eat lunch, travel and learn until
8, eat dinner and then hang out as a group. There are about 1-2 hours during the
day of true time to yourself and I have started waking up at 6:30-7:00 to boost
that number. There is just too much to write about with not enough time, as each
experience could merit its own 2,000+ word reflection. Changing the model for
these blogs into something where we can talk about the overall themes on a bigger
picture, rather than breaking down each, individual moment, is going to be more
fruitful in terms of meaningful conclusions.

## AAAAAHHHHH

**AAAAAAHHHHH**

A member of our weird team of lovely people made an excellent point the other
day that the reason why we are all so exhausted is because everything we do
here requires conscious thought. There are very little routines or opportunities
in which we can just zone out and turn off our brains during the day. Hopefully
you can imagine my lack of motivation therefore when I say that there were
definitely moments in which I had time to write but did not want to. For instance,
here is a collection of activities that I did instead of write:

* Play Egyptian Rat Slap
* Play Hearts
* Play Mafia
* Talk
* Nap
* Code
* Swim in a frickin' crater lake
* Eat
* Hike
* Meditate
* Read
* Listen to music

Through these activities I've been not only able to hit F5 and refresh, but also
had the chance to really become friends with the weird people in this group. I
love these guys and do not regret choosing to get to know them over writing and
publishing something on this blog.
