During the past week on this global intensive for COEN3050, our little
band of merry travelers have gone on 24+ excursions within four distinct
regions: Kampala, Kabale, Lake Bunyonyi and Kigali. We've seen everything from
the Katanga slums and the Kigali Genocide Memorial, to incredible jaw-dropping
feats of nature, all of which we will never forget.

I had made it my mission during the start of this trip to capture our experiences
in a way that would convey their meaningfulness. I wanted to share what I was
learning and doing with those who were interested so they may obtain second-hand
awareness for the important takeaways us Westerners were, well, taking away from
this trip. What's funny is that over the past week, this is exactly what I haven't
been doing.

The last time I published something about this trip was two days ago, but that
post was a reflection on our first day in Kampala which was over a week ago. So why
did this occur? Why did I not succeed? What happened that had caused me to not achieve
this goal I was at one point so motivated to lunge for?

> Well, I tripped and broke both my arms.

Nah nothing along those lines- maybe not so much for my parents, but that would've
been an easy answer. After some reflection, I've determined there is not one, but
three considerations in addressing this question.

## FOOBAR: Form yOur Opinions, Ban Accurately Reciting

A couple of days ago, our amazing professor on this trip posed a question to
try and help us digest this incredible fire hose that has been pouring information
into us since Day 00. She essentially asked us to reflect on what we have learned
about and then try and conclude what we have learned from those things we have
learned about. Of course, she put it more eloquently than I, however the concept
of learning about something (memorizing facts, history, etc.) and learning
from something (forming conclusions and inferences) is super powerful and
was an incredibly helpful tool in prioritization of thought.

In my initial posts I was trying so so hard to accurately retell my days, that
two seeds were planted into my mind:

* *Holy shit there's a lot to remember, what if I forget?*
* *Holy shit what am I going to say?*

I was so worried about trying to remember all that was *learned about* that the
*learned from* became shadowed. These posts became more of a responsibility than
an enjoyable exercise, which is why I kept putting them off. I just didn't want
to do them and instead I found myself drifting more towards focusing on internally
and interpersonally discussing the trip to reflect, which, I should mention is not
a bad thing. Reflection through internal thought and discussion is an important
thing to do, but I was missing out on the key component of learning to communicate
what I was learning to those who aren't on the trip.

## WTF: Woah That's Fruitful

What our Lost Boys and Girls have also learned is that we are constantly moving.
We eat breakfast and then travel and learn until about 2. We then eat lunch and
travel and learn until about 8. We then eat dinner, discuss the events of the day
and then hang out as a group until about midnight. There were of course variations
in this schedule, but a literal full day of events for about two weeks straight
can take a lot out of you. There are about 1-2 hours during the day of true time
to yourself and I have started waking up at 6:30-7:00 to boost that number. There
is just too much to write about with not enough time, as each experience could merit
its own 2,000+ word reflection. Changing the model for these blogs into something
where we can talk about the overall themes on a bigger picture, rather than breaking
down each, individual moment, is going to be more fruitful in terms of communicating
meaningful conclusions.

## AAAAAHHHHH: AAAAAAHHHHH

A member of our weird team of lovely people made an excellent point the other
day that the reason why we are all so exhausted is because everything we do
here requires conscious thought. There are very little routines and not so many
opportunities in which we can just zone out and turn off our brains during the day.
Hopefully you can imagine my lack of motivation therefore when I say that there were
definitely moments in which I had time to write but did not want to. For instance,
here is a collection of activities that I did instead of write during our free time.

* Play card games (Egyptian Rat Slap, Hearts, Mao)
* Play Mafia
* Determine the probability of being in the mafia two rounds in a row
* Take stupid quizzes with my new friends
* Talk
* Nap
* Code
* Swim in a frickin' crater lake (Lake Bunyonyi)
* Eat
* Hike
* Meditate
* Read
* Listen to music
* Start at a wall
* Try Banana Wine (mixes well with Fanta)
* Watch distorted soccer on TV
* Watch the African equivalent to MTV

Through these activities I've been not only able to hit F5 and refresh, but also
have had the chance to really become friends with the weird people in this group.
I love these guys and do not regret choosing to get to know them over writing and
publishing something on this blog.

> OK that sounded a bit dramatic, but you get the idea.

## Moving Forward

This trip has been framed entirely within the mindset of a three step process for
processing the world:

* Learn about (Listen)
* Learn from (Think)
* Act (Act)

Over the next week and beyond, I'm going to take some of the hardest hitting and
profound ideas that I've learned from the trip and try to convey them within this
framework. I'll do a little post that gives an overview of everything that our group
of strange students did so that you can get an idea of how intensely dense a Global
Intensive is, but other than that I'll only be using our experiences as anecdotal
evidence (the *learned about*) from now on.

See you soon.
