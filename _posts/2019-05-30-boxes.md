Take a second, or more than a second if you have the time to spare, and
just think about the two words 'my life'. Now, hold these words in your brain
and close your eyes for a bit.

What did you see? What did your mind think about? Did it think about the past?
Or the present? The future? Something entirely random and strange like why we have
ten fingers and toes instead of 16? What kind of emotions did your body feel? Where
did those emotions come from?

Everything that happened in those moments of nothing, and everything that happens
in moments of something during our days and nights as well, are reflections of
our box.

Boxes are kick-ass for building forts, but they also act as a great symbol for
conveying our life situation. If you were tasked with filling a box with everything
that your life is, what would you put inside? How big or small would your box be?
What would you leave out of your box? Now pretend for a second that this box could
be made to be a true, 100% accurate reflection of you, whether your wanted it to
be or not. What would be inside your box that you are afraid of seeing? What would
be inside your box that you are proud of? What would be inside your box that you
didn't even know was there?

As human beings, it is our responsibility to ourselves and to one another to understand
and accept what's in our box, yet doing so requires going out of our way to understand
what's in other boxes that are completely different than our own. Only when we
have made an effort to get uncomfortable and reach outside of our box can we then
know what we want our box to look like and how to go about the process of change.

Personally, my box is filled with suburban white comfort. I have Legos with the
words 'future', 'career' and 'purpose' that I build with everyday. The words
'bias', 'guilt' and 'privilege' and 'rich' cover each wall, as if Bart Simpson
wrote them there in detention after school. A quiet laughing track plays in the
background constantly and the silhouettes of my peers peek down at me through the
open ceiling.

But in the center of my box is a closed-off and dark room of distraction and
isolation, containing a couch, Netflix, my phone and food and water where I spend
most of my time.

I was a tourist in Uganda for about two weeks and now I've been back home in
Colorado for a little less than a week. Being taken outside of my box and then
thrown back in has been one of the most uncomfortable yet eye-opening experiences
of my life.

While I was in Uganda I learned that I had enough cash in my backpack to pay for
a semester of someone's tuition, and that the whole trip cost could've provided
for three people's entire undergrad degree. I visited places where people faced
challenges that I had never even had to think about, such as the availability
of clean water, food and sanitary products. Yet in these places I met inspiring
people who were living their lives with true intention.

I came face to face with the guilt of my privilege and was met with the fact that
I should not be guilty of it, for I should only be guilty of not accepting my
life for what is and then living it how I want to live it. The value that we place
on other peoples' boxes is only relative to our own.

It sounds like a Hallmark Car, however I think it has some real merit: The true
value of a box has nothing to do with the box itself, but rather the person living
inside of it.

> Oh BTW the title is a reference to a show called [*Weeds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeds_%28TV_series%29).
> I'd definitely give it a peek- it's on Netflix.
